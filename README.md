## Medicine Recommendation System with Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to develop a robust medicine recommendation system by leveraging sentiment analysis on drug review datasets. The system employs a stacked ensemble technique combining Logistic Regression (LR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to accurately classify and analyze user sentiments towards various medications.

**Key Features:**

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on a large corpus of drug reviews to extract valuable insights and classify user opinions as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **LR-LSTM Stacked Ensemble**: Implement a stacked ensemble model that combines the strengths of Logistic Regression and LSTM neural networks for improved sentiment classification accuracy.
- **Drug Review Dataset**: Utilize a comprehensive drug review dataset containing user reviews, ratings, and other relevant metadata.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the drug review data, including text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction, to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train the LR and LSTM models separately, and then combine them using a stacked ensemble approach. Evaluate the performance of the ensemble model using appropriate metrics.
- **Recommendation Engine**: Develop a recommendation engine that suggests suitable medications based on user preferences, sentiment analysis results, and other relevant factors.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Create a user-friendly web interface or command-line application for users to input their preferences, view drug recommendations, and explore sentiment analysis insights.

**Technologies Used:**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, spaCy
- **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Web Development** (optional): Flask, Django, React, or other frontend frameworks
- **Deployment** (optional): Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku

This project demonstrates proficiency in sentiment analysis, natural language processing, machine learning model development (including ensemble techniques), and recommendation system design. The codebase adheres to best practices, including version control with Git, modular design, and comprehensive documentation.

Feel free to explore the repository, provide feedback, or contribute to further enhancing the system's capabilities.
